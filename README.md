# BlockTrail Explorer

## 📌 Project Description
BlockTrail Explorer is a lightweight decentralized data registry that allows users to create, store, and update "trail" metadata directly on the blockchain. Each trail represents a piece of information linked with timestamps and creator identity, forming an immutable breadcrumb system for on-chain activity.

## 🚀 Project Vision
The vision of BlockTrail Explorer is to serve as a foundational layer for future decentralized indexing tools, audit systems, and data-tracking protocols. It aims to make blockchain-based metadata traceable, accessible, and transparent.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Trail Creation**  
  Users can record data or metadata on-chain, each linked to timestamps and creator identities.

- **Trail Retrieval**  
  Anyone can fetch trail information using its unique ID.

- **Trail Updates**  
  Trail creators can update their data while maintaining transparent on-chain modification history.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Add event emissions for better off-chain indexing  
- Introduce role-based access control  
- Add trail deletion or archival mechanisms  
- Integrate with IPFS for storing larger datasets  
- Build a frontend explorer UI for browsing trails
